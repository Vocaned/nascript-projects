# Brainfuck interpreter in Not Awesome Script

This script has two versions, `bf-visualized.nas` and `bf-optimized.nas`. The optimized version strips away most unnecessary actions to try to reduce the amount of actions ran. Unfortunately neither version can run any moderately complex code, as the scripting language has a limit on actions a script can run. In the future this can possibly be fixed by having the player restart the script every time the action limit is hit.

Visualized version shows the memory as blocks on the map.
